# Research_Project_Master

This is a documentation for a university lecture project. 

The model should be used to display the influence of wood substitution in the furniture market in Austria. 

Within the model.py file, you can find the actual model developed from our research project group. 

The model will create 3 png files as which display the plots and one csv file, which contains all the necessary data. 

## NOTICE: 

If you want to display your results with the show.py program, please store the png files, created from the model, in the static directory. Once the files are stored, start the show.py file and navigate to the link, provided in the output terminal.
