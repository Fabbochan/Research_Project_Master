# Research_Project_Master

This is a documentation for a university lecture project. 

The model should be used to display the influence of wood substitution in the furniture market in Austria. 

Within the model.py file, you can find the actual model developed from our research project group. 

Within the show.py file, you can find a FLASK app, that if you run it, will open the basic home page on the default port, which will display the 3 png files saved in the static folder from the model.
